# Relay starter kit with Relay Modern

ps. In `js` folder, `Root.js` is not currently used for rendering. Just trying to get `App.js` working first.

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### Error
Now go to `http://localhost:3000`, there's the following error in console.

```

errors: [{message: "Must provide query string."}] (1)
operation: {fragment: Object, id: null, kind: "Batch", metadata: Object, name: "AppQuery", â€¦}
variables: {count: 10}
```
